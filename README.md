# Lightweight chart playground

A single-page TypeScript playground that shows how to host a TradingView Lightweight Chart and draw custom overlay shapes in state. You can add or remove predefined lines and rectangles without any Python tooling.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the dev server URL from the terminal. Use the controls above the chart to set the start/end points for a line or rectangle, choose a color, and add it to the overlay. Each drawing is tracked in state so you can delete it at any time.
